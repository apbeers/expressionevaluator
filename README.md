# expressionevaluator

This was teh final project in my Programming Foundations 2 class.

to use, enter a string of expressions separated by semicolons
ex) 2+5;9*9/6;

then for actions, the options are
1. < for postfix
2. > for prefix
3. = to evaluate
4. f to print out fully parethesized version

you can also use varaibles in the input. when evaluated, it will use the data from the varaibles
ex) a+b;a=9;b=-4;
